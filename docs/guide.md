# User Guide

<div class="key-takeaway">
Check the evidence level first, then the recommendation, then read the source literature.

## Looking up a drug

<ol class="actionable-steps">
<li>Use the search box at the top of the page (generic ingredient names match better than brand names).</li>
<li>Or browse the full list on <a href="{{ '/drugs/' | relative_url }}">All Drugs</a>.</li>
<li>You can also browse by evidence level: <a href="{{ '/evidence-high/' | relative_url }}">high</a>, <a href="{{ '/evidence-medium/' | relative_url }}">moderate</a>, <a href="{{ '/evidence-low/' | relative_url }}">model prediction only</a>.</li>
</ol>

## Reading a report

<p class="key-answer" data-question="What do evidence levels L1 to L5 mean?">
Each drug report lists predicted new indications, and each indication carries an L1&ndash;L5 evidence
level. <strong>L1 means multiple Phase 3 randomised controlled trials already support it; L5 means
model prediction only, with no human evidence.</strong> Full criteria are on the
<a href="{{ '/methodology/' | relative_url }}">Methodology</a> page.
</p>

| If you see | It means | Suggested action |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| L1 / L2 | Clinical trial evidence exists | Review the source NCT and PMID records |
| L3 / L4 | Observational or preclinical evidence | Treat as a research lead |
| L5 | Model prediction only | Hypothesis generation only; not for clinical reference |

## Citation and traceability

Every piece of evidence in a report carries a traceable identifier:

- **NCT number**: links to the ClinicalTrials.gov registration
- **PMID**: links to the PubMed record
- **DrugBank ID**: links to drug and target data

Please read the source literature to confirm context before citing any conclusion from this platform.

## Frequently asked questions

<p class="key-answer" data-question="Can predictions be used clinically?">
<strong>No.</strong> Predictions on this platform are research leads, not clinical advice. Any
clinical application of drug repurposing must go through full clinical trial validation and
regulatory review.
</p>

<p class="key-answer" data-question="Why can't I find a particular drug?">
An ingredient must map to the DrugBank vocabulary to be included in prediction. Herbal extracts,
vaccines, excipients and other items not catalogued by DrugBank do not appear on this platform.
</p>
