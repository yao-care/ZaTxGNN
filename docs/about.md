## Background

<p class="key-answer" data-question="What is ZaTxGNN?">
<strong>ZaTxGNN</strong> is a research-support platform for drug repurposing, built on the TxGNN
model published in <em>Nature Medicine</em> by the Zitnik Lab at Harvard University. It predicts
indication expansion for medicines approved by SAHPRA in South Africa. Beyond AI prediction scores,
the platform integrates clinical evidence from ClinicalTrials.gov and PubMed so researchers can
quickly assess how credible each prediction is.

## About the Developer

This platform is developed and operated by **藥提醒科技有限公司** (yao.care, company registration
number 83620786, 12F, No. 220, Sec. 2, Taiwan Blvd., West Dist., Taichung City, Taiwan).

ZaTxGNN is the South Africa site of the company's "TxGNN Drug Repurposing" product line.
The same system is deployed across 30 countries and regions, each named `{CC}TxGNN`
(JpTxGNN, UsTxGNN, DETxGNN, and so on) at `{cc}txgnn.yao.care`.
Product overview: <https://www.yao.care/medical/txgnn/>.

The TxGNN model itself was developed by the Zitnik Lab at Harvard Medical School and published
in *Nature Medicine*. This platform is the production system 藥提醒科技有限公司 built on top of that
model, covering national drug-registration data integration, dual knowledge-graph and
deep-learning prediction, PubMed / ClinicalTrials evidence grading, and SMART on FHIR
electronic health record integration.

## What is drug repurposing?

<p class="key-answer" data-question="What is drug repurposing?">
<strong>Drug repurposing</strong> means finding new therapeutic uses for existing medicines.
Compared with developing a new drug from scratch — 10 to 15 years and USD 1&ndash;2 billion —
repurposing takes 3 to 5 years and USD 100&ndash;300 million, and human safety data already exists,
so the risk of failure is lower.
